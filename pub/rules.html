<h1>Hnafetafl rules</h1>
<p>
Hnefatafl is an asymmetrical board game for two players. The "Attacker" (dark pieces) and the "Defender" (light pieces). On this site three different board variants can be played, however, aside from the initial layout, the rules are the same for all three variants. These rules are taken from Hingston [1]. The 11x11 layout was likewise adapted from Hingston, The 9x9 layout was adapted from the game of Tablut, though some of the rules differ [2]. Finally the 7x7 layout is adapted from an Irish variant of the game Brandubh [3]. 
</p>
<h2>Movement</h2>
<p>
The Attacker moves first. All pieces move in a manner identical to a rook in chess (e.g. anywhere along with a rank or a file as long as the path is unobstructed). A king can land on any empty square. A pawn can land anywhere except the corners of the board and the middle of the board (dark squares). Notably, though, if the middle square is empty, any piece can move through it.
</p>
<h2>Capture</h2>

<p>
Any pawn can be captured by surrounding it on two opposite sides. If a pawn is standing next to a corner or a middle (dark) square, it can be captured by sandwiching that pawn between the square and one's own pawn. A pawn cannot be captured against the edge of the board.
</p>
<h2>Winning</h2>
<p>
Generally, the game favors the defender. Each player has a different objective. The Attacker can win the game by capturing the king. The king can be captured by surrounding it on all four sides. If a king is on the edge of the board or on a dark, inaccessible square, it can still be captured by surrounding it on the remaining accessible squares. The defender can win the game by moving their king on one of the corner squares or capturing all of the Attacker's pieces. Either player can lose if they have no legal moves left. Likewise, either player can also lose if they run out of time.
